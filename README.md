### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Perry World House at the University of Pennsylvania, and I'm a political scientist with a PhD in comparative politics from the University of Notre Dame with secondary training in methods and theory. My [book project from my dissertation work](https://shanascogin.com/dissertation/) is on the governance of post-earthquake reconstruction in Nepal, which is the focus of my 2025.
- I love making stats R packages! I am an author and the maintainer of two called modeLLtest and BayesPostEst, and I maintain a third called coxrobust. The BayesPostEst package is due for an update to CRAN.
- I have been in and out of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal since 2018 for language training and projects. In 2022 and part of 2023, I was based in the Valley to conduct collect data for my dissertation and to work on a joint project on earthquake early warning with Duke University and the Institute of Engineering (IoE). In 2024, I accompanied a group of engineering and data science undergraduates from Duke to Nepal to meet up with students and recent graduates from IoE to help guide an interdisciplinary workshop held by the Duke-IoE Geo Lab.
- I have solo-authored and collaborative research published in *Disasters* and *Global Environmental Politics*.
- Please visit my [website](https://shanascogin.com/) or email me (sscogin@upenn.edu) if you're interested in seeing more of my work or materials.
- And - last but not least - if you have any questions, issues, or suggestions with/for my R packages - please don't hesitate to submit an issue or message me. I enjoy collaborating to make things better and more accessable.
