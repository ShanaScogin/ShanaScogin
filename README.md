### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a PhD Candidate writing a [dissertation](https://shanascogin.com/dissertation/) on the politics of post-earthquake reconstruction in Nepal. 
- I love making stats R packages! Check out my packages below and email me if you want to collaborate on one together. 
- This spring, I'm learning natural language processing in Python and R and am working more with GIS spatial data in ArcGIS. I'm also working on a new function for our [Bayesian statistics post-estimation package](https://github.com/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst).
- My name is pronounced "Sha-nuh," and my pronouns are she/her.
- Feel free to email me (sscogin@nd.edu) and introduce yourself!
