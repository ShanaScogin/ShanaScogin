### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a PhD Candidate writing a [dissertation](https://shanascogin.com/dissertation/) on the politics of post-earthquake reconstruction in Nepal. 
- I love making stats R packages! I am an author and the maintainer of two called modeLLtest and BayesPostEst, and I maintain a third called coxrobust.
- I am currently based in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal to conduct collect data for my dissertation and to work on a joint project on early earthquake warning with Duke University and the Institute of Engineering.
- I am on the job market this year. For more, please see my [website](https://shanascogin.com/) or email me (sscogin@nd.edu) for my materials.
- I love meeting new people and hearing about other projects - Feel free to email me (sscogin@nd.edu) and introduce yourself!
