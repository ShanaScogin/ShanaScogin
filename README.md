### Welcome! 👋

- I'm a PhD Candidate writing a [dissertation](https://shanascogin.com/dissertation/) on the politics of post-earthquake reconstruction in Nepal. 
- I love making stats R packages! Email me if you want to collaborate on one together. 
- This fall, I'm learning Portuguese, collaborating on a paper looking at urban water crises, and working on a paper about mutlilevel models.
- My name is pronounced "Sha-nuh" (though I also go by my middle name "Rachael") and my pronouns are she/her.
- I love meeting new people and hearing about other projects - Feel free to email me (sscogin@nd.edu) and introduce yourself!
