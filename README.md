### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a political scientist with a PhD in comparative politics from the University of Notre Dame with secondary training in methods and theory. My [book project from my dissertation work](https://shanascogin.com/dissertation/) is on the governance of post-earthquake reconstruction in Nepal. 
- I love making stats R packages! I am an author and the maintainer of two called modeLLtest and BayesPostEst, and I maintain a third called coxrobust. The BayesPostEst package is due for an update to CRAN.
- I was based in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal in 2022 and part of 2023 to conduct collect data for my dissertation and to work on a joint project on earthquake early warning with Duke University and the Institute of Engineering through the Fulbright. 
- I have solo-authored and collaborative research published in *Disasters* and *Global Environmental Politics*.
- I am on the job market this year. Please visit my [website](https://shanascogin.com/) or email me (sscogin@nd.edu) if you're interested in seeing more of my work or job market materials.
- And - last but not least - if you have any questions, issues, or suggestions with/for my R packages - please don't hesitate to submit an issue or message me. I enjoy collaborating to make things better and more accessable.
