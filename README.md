### Welcome! 👋

- I'm a PhD Candidate writing a [dissertation](https://shanascogin.com/dissertation/) on the politics of post-earthquake reconstruction in Nepal. 
- I love making stats R packages!
- This fall, I'm learning Portuguese, collaborating on a project about urban water crises, and working on a paper about mutlilevel models. I'm also a PhD fellow at the [Notre Dame Institute for Advanced Study](https://ndias.nd.edu/fellowships/themes/2021-2022-resilience/), where I meet weekly with an interdiscipinary group of scholars to discuss our research and themes of resilience.
- My name is pronounced "Sha-nuh" (you can also call me by my middle name, Rachael, or Shana Rachael) and my pronouns are she/her.
- I love meeting new people and hearing about other projects - Feel free to email me (sscogin@nd.edu) and introduce yourself!
