### Welcome!

- I'm a political scientist with a PhD in comparative politics from the University of Notre Dame with secondary training in methods and theory. I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Perry World House at the University of Pennsylvania, and I'll be starting as an Assistant Professor at Indiana University Bloomington's O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs in 2026.
- This academic year I'm advancing my [book project](https://shanascogin.com/book/) on the governance of post-earthquake reconstruction in urban Nepal as a number of my solo and collaborative papers find their 'homes.'
- I have been in and out of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal since 2018 for language training and projects. In 2022 and part of 2023, I was based in the Valley to conduct collect data for my dissertation and to work on a joint project on earthquake early warning with Duke University and the Institute of Engineering (IoE). In 2024, I accompanied a group of engineering and data science undergraduates from Duke to Nepal to meet up with students and recent graduates from IoE to help guide an interdisciplinary workshop held by the [Duke-IoE Geohazard Lab](https://ktmgeolab.org/). I'm committed to advancing disaster risk reduction, especially through the lens of interdisciplinary research. Please visit my [website](https://shanascogin.com/) or contact me if you want to know more.
- I am an author and the maintainer of two R packages called modeLLtest and BayesPostEst, and I maintain a third called coxrobust. The BayesPostEst package is due for an update to CRAN.
- And, last but not least, if you have any questions, issues, or suggestions with/for my R packages - please don't hesitate to submit an issue or message me. I enjoy collaborating to make things better and more accessable.
